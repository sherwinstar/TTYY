     that the compressed data will have gzip headers. This will make it easy to
     decompress the data later using a tool like gunzip, WinZip, etc.

     deflateInit2() accepts many parameters, the first of which is a C struct of
     type "z_stream" defined in zlib.h. The properties of this struct are used to
     control how the compression algorithms work. z_stream is also used to
     maintain pointers to the "input" and "output" byte buffers (next_in/out) as
     well as information about how many bytes have been processed, how many are
     left to process, etc. */

    /* Initialize the zlib deflation (i.e. compression) internals with deflateInit2().
     The parameters are as follows:

     z_streamp strm - Pointer to a zstream struct
     int level      - Compression level. Must be Z_DEFAULT_COMPRESSION, or between
     0 and 9: 1 gives best speed, 9 gives best compression, 0 gives
     no compression.
     int method     - Compression method. Only method supported is "Z_DEFLATED".
     int windowBits - Base two logarithm of the maximum window size (the size of
     the history buffer). It should be in the range 8..15. Add
     16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer
     around the compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper. The
     gzip header will have no file name, no extra data, no comment,
     no modification time (set to zero), no header crc, and the
     operating system will be set to 255 (unknown).
     int memLevel   - Amount of memory allocated for internal compression state.
     1 uses minimum memory but is slow and reduces compression
     ratio; 9 uses maximum memory for optimal speed. Default value
     is 8.
     int strategy   - Used to tune the compression algorithm. Use the value
     Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data
     produced by a filter (or predictor), or Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to
     force Huffman encoding only (no string match) */
